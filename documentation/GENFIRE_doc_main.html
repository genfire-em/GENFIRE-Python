	<p>
	GENFIRE, for GENeralized Fourier Iterative REconstruction, is an open-sourced, GUI-enabled
	python package for 3D reconstruction from arbitrarily oriented projection images. GENFIRE
	was developed at the University of California, Los Angeles and has found a number of 
	successful applications in a number of imaging fields including Atomic Electron Tomography (AET),
	electron cryo-tomography, tomographic Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM), and
	phase-contrast X-ray ptychographic tomography.<br><br>
	GENFIRE iterates between real and reciprocal space using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT),
	enforcing constraints in both. This technique of alternating projections onto convex sets allows
	GENFIRE to recover unmeasured datapoints, producing reconstructions with superior contrast 
	and mitigated missing-wedge artifacts when compared with traditional tomographic techniques such as 
	filtered backprojection. This type of reconstruction algorithm was originally demonstrated
	in the form of Equally Sloped Tomography (EST). GENFIRE builds upon EST by introducing a 3D
	gridding routine, allowing it to tolerate arbitrary Euler rotations of the input projection images.
	In addition, GENFIRE introduces a novel technique for enforcing Fourier constraints deemed 
	resolution extension/suppression and implements a modified version of R-free from X-ray crystallography
	for the purposes of prevention of overfitting data.<br><br>
	GENFIRE is written in python using primarily NumPy, SciPy, and pyFFTW. The gridding routine is 
	accelerated using Cython. The GUI is programmed entirely using Qt and the PyQt4 bindings to the Qt
	framework. The user interface was designed with Qt Creator. Embedded plots were made with matplotlib.

	<div class="h1_left"> Getting started </div>
	<p>
	GENFIRE can be downloaded for free <a href="tutorial.html">here</a>. There are precompiled binaries for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux, 
	and the code is also available as a python package. Installation instructions are 
	<a href="installation.html">here</a> Once you have installed GENFIRE, check out the 
	<a href="tutorial.html" alt="GENFIRE tutorial">tutorial</a>.

	<div class="h1_left">  About </div>
		<div class="h3_left">  Coordinate Conventions </div>

	<p>
	The coordinate and Euler angle conventions used in GENFIRE are the standard defined by 
	<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16043364">Heymann et. al (2005)</a>.<br> For 3D
	arrays the fastest changing index represents X, the second-fastest represents Y, and the slowest
	Z. GENFIRE is built on top of numpy and uses row-major array storage (sometimes called "C-style". 
	As such an array is indexed as [x, y, z]. <br>
	Euler rotations are composed of angle triplets in the form (phi, theta, psi) where:
		<ul>
			<li>Phi represents a rotation about the Z-axis</li>
			<li>Theta represents a rotation about the new Y-axis</li>
			<li>Psi represents a rotation about the new Z-axis</li>
		</ul>
